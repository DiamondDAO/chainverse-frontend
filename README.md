# Chainverse Frontend

## a user interface for Chainverse, a searchable web3 knowledge graph

[Chainverse](http://www.chainverse.diamonds) provides context and discovery of web3 information via a graph database, user-input notes, and data about web3 entities.

This repository is an instance of a front-end implementation of a UI to leverage the Chainverse components.

### What is Chainverse

- A graph data model to define relations between web3 entities and user-input `Note` blocks
- A GraphQL API to interact with a Neo4j database
- A set of data ingestion scripts to build a base layer of web3 entities

## Getting started with Chainverse

Before deploying to the `develop` branch run the command `npm run build` on the feature branch to identify any build errors.
